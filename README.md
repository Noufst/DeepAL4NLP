# EASE: Enhanced Active learning based on Sample diversity and data augmEntation

This code is based on DeepAL [1].

In EASE, we implement Active Learning with Data Augmentation and Sample Diversity for textual classfication. 

It includes Python implementations of the following active learning algorithms:

- Least Confidence [2]
- Margin Sampling [3]

We use the pre-trained BERT [4] as basic classifier and fine-tune it. One can replace it to other basic classifiers and add them to nets.py. 


## Prerequisites 

- Python                3.10.12
- numpy                 1.26.4
- pandas                2.1.4
- torch                 2.3.1
- sklearn               1.3.2
- nlpaug                1.1.11
- transformers          4.42.4
- sentence_transformers 3.0.1
